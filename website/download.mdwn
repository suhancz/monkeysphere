### Enhancements ###

As of 2008-08-22, If you run debian lenny you're very close to being
able to run a fully monkeysphere-enabled system.  One gap in the
system is that lenny's GnuTLS can't support the `monkeysphere
subkey-to-ssh-agent` subcommand.

You can install a patched version of GnuTLS to enable this feature of
the MonkeySphere by adjusting the monkeysphere `sources.list` lines to
include the `gnutls` component.  So they'd look like this instead:

	deb http://monkeysphere.info/debian experimental monkeysphere gnutls
	deb-src http://monkeysphere.info/debian experimental monkeysphere gnutls

You can [read more about this offering](/news/modified-gnutls-2.4.x-available.mdwn).

##git repositories##

Development is done in an extremely distributed manner using
[git](http://git.or.cz/). Once you've
[installed git](http://www.spheredev.org/wiki/Git_for_the_lazy), you can
clone the repository by doing

	git clone http://lair.fifthhorseman.net/~dkg/git/monkeysphere.git/ monkeysphere

Other developers have their own repositories, which you can substitute
for dkg's if you like.
